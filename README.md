# The evolution of the dust and gas content of quasars across cosmic time


The interaction between the nuclear activity in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and the interstellar medium (ISM) in their host galaxy, known as feedback, is a commonly used resource in simulation of galaxy evolution to quench the star formation (SF) and avoid an arbitrarily growth of galaxies  beyond the sizes that are currently observed. Outflows, from radio jets or radiation, is one of the proposed mechanisms. 

Nuclear outflows have been observed in broad lines of quasar spectra, however there is still a debate on their impact on the ISM of the host galaxy. The emission lines in the broad line region (BLR) of quasars spectra can be used as a probe of these outflows. 

We carried out a triple-Gaussian modeling for a sample of quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The quasars were selected from ALMA observations in the sub-mm with bands 6, 7 and 8; consisting of a subsample of undetected and detected objects within the ALMA footprint.

We analysed the C IV and Mg II lines in the optical spectra of the objects in both subsamples and found that the submm-bright quasars (detected objects) show an excess in the blueshift of the emission line with respect to the undetected objects; which indicates strong nuclear outflows in these quasars.

The model of each line allowed us to retrieve information on the broad component of the lines. The velocity distributions are not centered around zero and show mainly positive velocities for low redshift quasars (from the Mg II line and ruling out the undetected subsample) and in the opposite direction for higher redshifts (from the C IV line).
